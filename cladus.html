            <hr>
            <p>
                Clindamycin injection is used to treat certain types of bacterial infections, including infections of
                the lungs, skin, blood, bones, joints, female reproductive organs, and internal organs. Clindamycin is
                in a class of medications called lincomycin antibiotics. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of
                bacteria. <br><br>

                Antibiotics such as clindamycin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using
                antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists
                antibiotic treatment.

            <h3>How should this medicine be used?</h3>
            <hr>
            
            <p>
                Clindamycin injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 10 to 40 minutes or intramuscularly (into a muscle). It is usually given two to four times a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how well you respond to the medication. <br><br>
                You may receive clindamycin injection in a hospital, or you may be given the medication to use at home. If you have been told to use clindamycin injection at home, it is very important that you use the medication exactly as directed. Use clindamycin injection at about the same times every day. Follow the directions that you are given carefully, and ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you have any questions. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. <br><br>
                You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with clindamycin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. <br><br>
                Use clindamycin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using clindamycin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Other uses for this medicine</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Clindamycin injection is also sometimes used to treat malaria (a serious infection spread by mosquitoes in some parts of the world) and to prevent infection in people who are having certain types of surgery. Clindamycin injection is also sometimes used to treat anthrax (a serious infection that may be spread as part of a bioterror attack) and toxoplasmosis (an infection that may cause serious problems in people who do not have healthy immune systems and in unborn babies whose mothers are infected). Clindamycin injection is also used in some pregnant women to prevent passing an infection to the baby during birth.

                <br><br> This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more
                information.
