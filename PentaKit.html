            <p>Pantoprazole For Injection BP<br></p>
            <h3>What is pantoprazole?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach.
                <br><br>
                Pantoprazole is used to treat erosive esophagitis (damage to the esophagus from stomach acid caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) in adults and children who are at least 5 years old. Pantoprazole is usually given for up to 8 weeks at a time while your esophagus heals.
                <br><br>Pantoprazole is also used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other conditions involving excess stomach acid.
