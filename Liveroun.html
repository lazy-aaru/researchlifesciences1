            <h1>LIVEROUN</h1>
            <p>
                L-ornithine-L-aspartate Infusion</p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                L-ornithine-L-aspartate is a chemical that is broken down by the body to increase levels of two amino acids: ornithine and aspartic acid.
                <br><br>
                Ornithine and aspartic acid help to reduce levels of a toxic chemical called ammonia in the blood. <br><br>
                People use L-ornithine-L-aspartate for reduced brain function due to advanced liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy). It is also used for athletic performance, cirrhosis, and other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. <br><br>
                Don't confuse L-ornithine-L-aspartate with ornithine or aspartic acid. These are not the same.
            </p>
