            <h1>GLUTOUN 600</h1>
            <P>GLUTATHIONE INJECTION</P>
            <h3>What Is A Glutathione Injection? How Does It Work?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Glutathione is a tripeptide made up of glycine, cysteine, and glutamic acid. It is produced by the liver
                and is involved in several biological functions. Glutathione plays a role in tissue growth and repair,
                as well as in the creation of essential molecules and proteins. It also helps the immune system work
                properly.
                <br><br>
                Glutathione is primarily used to reduce minor cosmetic defects, brighten the complexion, and correct
                uneven skin tone. It can aid with cystic acne or unexpected breakouts too. Glutathione injections reduce
                hyperpigmentation, sun spots, wrinkles, acne, and even melasma by eliminating toxins and free radicals
                from the body. In addition, it possesses anti-inflammatory properties.
            </p>

            <h3>What Are The Benefits Of Glutathione Injections?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Glutathione promises increased energy, endurance, body cleansing, and, most significantly, better, whiter
                skin. Keep in mind, however, that these benefits have not been scientifically proven.

                <br> <br>Women in Asia reported increased energy, immune system boosts, sex drive, and brighter, whiter,
                radiant skin after receiving these injections. However, there are currently no studies that show it
                inhibits the enzyme tyrosinase, which is necessary for melanin formation.

                <br> <br>When delivered intravenously, Glutathione bypasses the body's sluggish and often unsuccessful
                digestive process. Being injected directly into the bloodstream ensures that the antioxidant is absorbed
                entirely and much faster than it would be if taken orally.

            <h3>Side Effects Of Glutathione Injections</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Getting a Glutathione injection, like any other cosmetic procedure, might have a number of side effects.
                Depending on the dosage, unwanted effects might range from moderate to severe. You should have these
                injections done by a competent and experienced medical specialist to minimize or reduce the severity of
                side effects.</p>
            <p>Major side effects such as renal failure or blood poisoning may develop if a patient is given a dosage
                that is far higher than recommended. Apart from that, some other side effects that may occur if the dose
                supplied is greater than 5 grammes include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Diarrhea</li>
                <li>Toxic effects on liver, kidney and nervous system</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Also, Glutathione drips usually contain vitamin C, and using them could lead to the formation of kidney
                stones. In fact, skin lightening treatment involving Glutathione could also lead to Stevens-Johnson
                Syndrome.
