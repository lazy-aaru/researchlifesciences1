            <p>Meropenem Injection <br>
                pronounced as (mer oh pen' em)</p>
            <h3>Why is this medication prescribed?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Meropenem injection is used to treat skin and abdominal (stomach area) infections caused by bacteria and
                meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) in adults and children 3
                months of age and older. Meropenem injection is in a class of medications called antibiotics. It works
                by killing bacteria that cause infection.
                <br><br>
                Antibiotics such as meropenem injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking
                antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists
                antibiotic treatment.
            </p>

            <h3>How should this medicine be used?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Meropenem injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and injected intravenously (into a vein).
                It is usually given every 8 hours. The length of treatment depends on your general health, the type of
                infection you have, and how well you respond to the medication. Your doctor will tell you how long to
                use meropenem injection. After your condition improves, your doctor may switch you to another antibiotic
                that you can take by mouth to complete your treatment.

                <br> <br> You may receive meropenem injection in a hospital, or you may administer the medication at
                home. If
                you will be receiving meropenem injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the
                medication. Be sure that you understand these directions and ask your healthcare provider if you have
                any questions.

                <br> <br> You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with meropenem
                injection. If
                your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.

                <br> <br> Use meropenem injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you
                stop
                using meropenem injection too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated
                and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.

                <br> <br> Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
            </p>

            <h3>Other uses for this medicine</h3>
