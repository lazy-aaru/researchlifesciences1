            <h3>Why is this medication prescribed?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Cefuroxime is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria, such as bronchitis(infection of the
                airway tubes leading to the lungs); gonorrhea (a sexually transmitted disease); Lyme disease (an
                infection that may develop after a person is bitten by a tick); and infections of the skin, ears,
                sinuses, throat, tonsils,, and urinary tract. Cefuroxime is in a class of medications called
                cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.
                <br><br>
                Antibiotics such as cefuroxime will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using
                antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists
                antibiotic treatment.
            </p>


            <!--How should this medicine be used?-->

            <h3>How should this medicine be used?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Cefuroxime comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12
                hours for 5-10 days, depending on the condition being treated. To treat gonorrhea, cefuroxime is taken
                as a single dose, and to treat Lyme disease, cefuroxime is taken every 12 hours for 20 days. Take the
                suspension with food; the tablet may be taken with or without food . Take cefuroxime at around the same
                times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or
                pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefuroxime exactly as directed. Do not take
                more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
                <br> <br> Different cefuroxime products are absorbed by the body in different ways and cannot be
                substituted for one another. If you need to switch from one cefuroxime product to another, your doctor
                may need to adjust your dose.

                <br> <br> Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.

                <br> <br> The tablets should be swallowed whole. Because the crushed tablet has a strong bitter taste,
                the tablet should not be crushed. Children who cannot swallow the tablet whole should take the liquid
                instead.
                <br> <br> You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefuroxime. If
                your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.
                <br> <br> Take cefuroxime until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking
                cefuroxime too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated, and the bacteria may
                become resistant to antibiotics.
            </p>


            <!--Other uses for this medicine-->

            <h3>Other uses for this medicine</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Cefuroxime is also sometimes used to treat pneumonia. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this
                medication for your condition.

                <br><br> This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more
                information.

            <h3>What special precautions should I follow?</h3>
            <hr><br>
            <h4>Before taking cefuroxime,</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to meropenem, other carbapenem antibiotics such

                    antibiotics such as cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime (Ceftin, Zinacef), and cephalexin (Keflex);
                    other beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin or amoxicillin (Amoxil, Trimox, Wymox); any other
                    medications, or any of the ingredients in meropenem injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the
                    ingredients.</li><br>

                <li>Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins,
                    nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention
                    probenecid (Probalan, in Col-Probenecid) and valproic acid (Depakene). Your doctor may need to
                    change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li><br>

                <li>The following nonprescription products may interact with cefuroxime: cimetidine, famotidine
                    (Pepcid), omeprazole (Prilosec), ranitidine (Zantac). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know
                    that you are taking these medications before you start taking cefuroxime. Do not start any of these
                    medications while taking cefuroxime without discussing with your healthcare provider.</li><br>

                <li>If you are taking antacids that contain magnesium or aluminum, take them at least 1 hour before or 2
                    hours after cefuroxime.</li><br>

                <li>Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had gastrointestinal disease (GI; affecting the stomach or
                    intestines), especially colitis (condition that causes swelling in the lining of the colon [large
                    intestine]), or kidney or liver disease.</li><br>

                <li>You should know that cefuroxime decreases the effectiveness of some oral contraceptives ('birth
                    control pills). You will need to use another form of birth control while taking this medication.
                    Talk to your doctor about other ways to prevent pregnancy while you are taking this medication.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become
                    pregnant while taking cefuroxime, call your doctor.</li>
                <li>if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to
                    prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that
                    cefuroxime suspension is sweetened with aspartame that forms phenylalanine.</li><br>
