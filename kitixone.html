            <p>Ceftriaxone Injection
                <br>
                pronounced as (sef try ax' one)
            </p>
            <h3>Why is this medication prescribed?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Ceftriaxone injection is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as gonorrhea (a
                sexually transmitted disease), pelvic inflammatory disease (infection of the female reproductive organs
                that may cause infertility), meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal
                cord), and infections of the lungs, ears, skin, urinary tract, blood, bones, joints, and abdomen.
                Ceftriaxone injection is also sometimes given before certain types of surgery to prevent infections that
                may develop after the operation. Ceftriaxone injection is in a class of medications called cephalosporin
                antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.
                <br><br>
                Antibiotics such as ceftriaxone injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.Using
                antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists
                antibiotic treatment.
            </p>

            <h3>How should this medicine be used?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Ceftriaxone injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid, or as a premixed product, to be injected
                intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 30 or 60 minutes.Ceftriaxone injection can also be given
                intramuscularly (into a muscle). It is sometimes given as a single dose and sometimes given once or
                twice a day for 4-14 days, depending on the type of infection being treated.


                <br> <br> You may receive ceftriaxone injection in a hospital or doctor's office, or you may administer
                the medication at home. If you will be receiving ceftriaxone injection at home, your healthcare provider
                will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your
                healthcare provider if you have any questions.


                <br> <br> You should begin to feel better during the first few days of your treatment with ceftriaxone
                injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.

                <br> <br> If you will be using more than one dose of ceftriaxone injection, use the medication until you
                finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ceftriaxone injection too soon or
                skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to
                antibiotics.


                <br> <br> Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
            </p>

            <h3>Other uses for this medicine</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Ceftriaxone injection is also sometimes used to treat sinus infections, endocarditis (infection of the
                heart lining and valves), chancroid (genital sores caused by bacteria), Lyme disease (an infection that
                is transmitted by tick bites that may cause problems with the heart, joints, and nervous system),
                relapsing fever (an infection that is transmitted by tick bites that causes repeated episodes of fever),
                shigella (an infection that causes severe diarrhea), typhoid fever (a serious infection that is common
                in developing countries), salmonella (an infection that causes severe diarrhea), and Whipple's disease
                (a rare infection that causes serious problems with digestion). Ceftriaxone injection is also sometimes
                used to prevent infection in certain penicillin-allergic patients who have a heart condition and are
                having a dental or upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, throat, voice box) procedure, patients who have
                fever and are at high risk for infection because they have very few white blood cells, close contacts of
                someone who is sick with meningitis, and in people who have been sexually assaulted or who have been
                bitten by humans or animals. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your
                condition.</p>
