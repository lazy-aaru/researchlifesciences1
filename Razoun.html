            <p>RABEPRAZOLE</p>
            <h3>Why is this medication prescribed?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Rabeprazole is used to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which
                backward flow of acid from the stomach causes heartburn and possible injury of the esophagus (the tube
                that connects the throat and stomach) in adults and children 12 year of age and older. Rabeprazole is
                used to treat damage from GERD, allow the esophagus to heal, and prevent further damage to the esophagus
                in adults. Rabeprazole is also used to treat conditions in which the stomach produces too much acid,
                such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in adults. Rabeprazole is used to treat ulcers (sores in the lining
                of the stomach or intestine) and is used in combination with other medications to eliminate H. pylori (a
                bacteria that causes ulcers) in adults. Rabeprazole is in a class of medications called proton-pump
                inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.

            </p>

            <h3>How should this medicine be used?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Rabeprazole comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of
                the medication by stomach acids) tablet to take by mouth. The delayed-release tablets are usually taken
                once a day. When used to treat ulcers, rabeprazole tablets are taken after the morning meal. When used
                in combination with other medications to eliminate H. pylori, rabeprazole tablets are taken twice a day,
                with the morning and evening meals, for 7 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label
                carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rabeprazole
                exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer period of time
                than prescribed by your doctor.


                <br> <br> Swallow the tablets whole with water; do not split, chew, or crush them.


                <br> <br> Continue to take rabeprazole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rabeprazole without
                talking to your doctor. If your condition does not improve or gets worse, call your doctor.
