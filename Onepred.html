            <h3>What is methylprednisolone?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid medicine that prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. <br><br>

                Methylprednisolone is used to treat many different inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, allergic disorders, gland (endocrine) disorders, and conditions that affect the skin, eyes, lungs, stomach, nervous system, or blood cells. <br><br>
                
                Methylprednisolone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.
            </p>

            <h3>Warnings</h3>
            <hr>
<p>You should not use this medicine if you have a fungal infection anywhere in your body.</p>
<p>Before taking methylprednisolone, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, and about all other medicines you are using. There are many other diseases that can be affected by steroid use, and many other medicines that can interact with steroids.</p>
<p>Steroid medication can weaken your immune system, making it easier for you to get an infection or worsening an infection you already have or have recently had. Tell your doctor about any illness or infection you have had within the past several weeks.</p>
<p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Call your doctor for preventive treatment if you are exposed to chicken pox or measles. Do not receive a "live" vaccine while using this medicine. The vaccine may not work as well during this time, and may not fully protect you from disease.</p>
<p>Do not stop using methylprednisolone suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Talk to your doctor about how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when stopping the medication. Any doctor, dentist, or emergency medical professional who treats you should know that you take steroid medication.</p>

            <h3>Before taking this medicine</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>You should not use methylprednisolone if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a fungal infection anywhere in your body.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Methylprednisolone can weaken your immune system, making it easier for you to get an infection. Steroids can also worsen an infection you already have, or reactivate an infection you recently had. Tell your doctor about any illness or infection you have had within the past several weeks.</p>
            <p>To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:
                <ul>
                    <li>a thyroid disorder;</li>
                    <li>herpes infection of the eyes;</li>
                    <li>stomach ulcers, ulcerative colitis, or diverticulitis;</li>
                    <li>depression, mental illness, or psychosis;</li>
                    <li>liver disease (especially cirrhosis);</li>
                    <li>high blood pressure;</li>
                    <li>osteoporosis;</li>
                    <li>a muscle disorder such as myasthenia gravis; or</li>
                    <li>multiple sclerosis.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>Also tell your doctor if you have diabetes. Steroid medicines may increase the glucose (sugar) levels in your blood or urine. You may also need to adjust the dose of your diabetes medications.

            </p>
            <p>It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p>
            <p>It is not known whether methylprednisolone passes into breast milk or if it could affect the nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</p>
