                Doxycycline injection is used to treat or prevent bacterial infections, including pneumonia and other
                respiratory tract infections. It is also used to treat certain skin, genital, intestine, and urinary
                system infections. Doxycycline injection may be used to treat or prevent anthrax (a serious infection
                that may be spread on purpose as part of a bioterror attack) in people who may have been exposed to
                anthrax in the air. Doxycycline injection is in a class of medications called tetracycline antibiotics.
                It works by killing bacteria that cause infections. <br><br>

                Antibiotics such as doxycycline injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.
                Taking or using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later
                that resists antibiotic treatment.

            <h3>How should this medicine be used?</h3>
            <hr>

            <p>
                Doxycycline injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein). It is usually given every 12 or 24 hours over a period of 1 to 4 hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how your body responds to the medication. <br><br>
                You may receive doxycycline injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving doxycycline injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. <br> <br>
                You may receive doxycycline injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home.

Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. <br><br>
                Use doxycycline injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using doxycycline injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.
